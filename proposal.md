## Description
This is going to be a timed trivia game for entertainment and educational purposes. The questions will be related to art history.

## Features
- Click on the answer choices
	- in a function to check which answer choice was clicked on, I'll use box.collidepoint(pos) and to check if the right answer was chosen, I'll use an if statement.
- Keep track of the user's score
	- I will use a score variable
- Each question has a timer
	- I will use a timer variable in an if statement
- Celebratory animation
    - I want to implement a small confetti animation for if the user gets all answers correct. The animation will be similar to the digital rain.

## Challenges
- I don't know what fonts are available or how to change them, so I'll have to see if I can import fonts or not. 
- I will have to create a unique animation for if the user wins the game, I plan to make it similar to digital rain except it only runs once.
- I want to see if I can randomize the questions after a game ends so that each round is different.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- There will be around 15 questions that randomize after a game ends and a 10 second timer to answer each one. If an incorrect answer is picked, the game ends, and if all answers are correct, a short celebratory animation covers the screen. The total score is displayed after the game ends. The font, colors, and layout are all appealing. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A new question is generated after an answer choice is clicked on. There is an appealing interface and a final score is displayed after each question has been answered or after the game ends.
