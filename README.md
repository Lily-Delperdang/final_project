## Description
I made a trivia game about digital arts, animation, and film, all things related to me as an ATEC major. There are 15 questions with a 15 second timer for each. Wrong answer choices turn pink when clicked on and turn back to gold when the correct answer is chosen. The questions shuffle after each game ends, and there are two different end game states. Game over happens when the timer runs out and game won happens when all questions run out. A simple confetti animation happend when the game is won. The timer also stops when the game ends.
